Online Bank System

I created an online banking system with features such as Check Balance, Deposit Money, Withdraw Money,Account Register and Exit. First, the user is required to log in to the system using their username and password. Unregistered users can click the register button to be taken to the registration page, where they can sign up to access the system. User credentials are securely stored in a database.

Once the user has logged in or registered, the system will prompt them with a new page containing four options: 1. Balance, 2. Deposit, 3. Withdraw, 4. Acoount Register and 5. Exit.

Check Balance: If the user selects option 1, they will be required to enter their ID to check their balance. After entering the ID, the system will display the current balance.

Deposit Money: If the user selects option 2, they will be required to enter their ID and the amount they wish to deposit. After clicking the deposit button, the system will display a message confirming the deposit. The user can then click Exit to return to the main page.

Withdraw Money: If the user selects option 3, they will be required to enter their ID and the amount they wish to withdraw. After clicking the withdraw button, the system will display a message confirming the withdrawal. The user can then click Exit to return to the main page.

Account ID register: A user is required to create an account ID and provide a starting balance. After entering this information, they should click the "Register" button to complete the registration process.

This user-friendly online banking system ensures that users can easily manage their accounts by checking their balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money with just a few clicks.]

Admin Feature: Admin can login using their username and password. Admin will be able to see every Account that is registered in our system.

News Feature: User will be able to view latest news about trends.
